To compile server: gcc -pthread -o s server.c
To compile client: gcc -o c client.c

1) you need whatever menus are necessary to interface with the user
2) get the users request
3) handle whatever there is on the client side
4) format message for the server to handle whatever it needs to
5) get the server response and output whatever is needed to the user

The biggest problem I ran into was converting the buffer string from char 
array to int and back.  You can look at the server to see how I parsed the 
message (an array of char[BUF_SIZE] where each row is a separate entry)

 flag tied to account verification. 
 Once a user has verified their account 
 the flag becomes active, 
	-client is then allowed to do regular atm activities. 
 If a user tries to do those things before verification
	-check against the flag will result in an error prompting them to verify first. 
	
	I think that SHOULD work with the multiple thread setup since 
	in that case all of the data checking lies on the client and 
	no unnecessary communication happens between client and server
