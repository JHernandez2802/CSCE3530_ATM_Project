Added Line 7 for boolean
#include <stdbool.h>

Added Line 31 for active account flag
bool active;

Added Lines 178-212 to see if any accounts have been created
and to see if there are any active accounts if there has.
	- Instead of the for loop in lines 197-200 we can use
	if(userAccounts[userID]==true;
		flagCheck++;
	

Added Lines 260-261 in 101 switch case to raise active account flag
//Flag to label account as active to deposit/withdraw
userAccounts[index].active=true;	

Added Lines 769-773 (strcpy and bytes_sent wasn't there originally)
case 801: 	printf("Client %d: Code 801 Logout\n", user);
			strcpy(returnMsg, "803");
			bytes_sent = send(sock, returnMsg, strlen(returnMsg), 0);
			
			break;
	
Added Lines 786-788 to deactivate any active accounts
	for(i=0;i<numAccounts;i++)
		userAccounts[i].active==false;
